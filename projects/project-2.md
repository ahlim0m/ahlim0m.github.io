This is a team project created in Fall 2014 designed to help students learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming. The project was created using [Java](https://www.java.com/en/). Our task was to design and create a music video with the song of our team's choice using simple Java code to rotate, translate, enlarge, and shrink images. 

This project introduced me to the world of programming, and has made programming fun and interesting. I learned the basics of coding and object orientiation through the project, which helped improve my programming skills.
