## Personal interests in software engineering

In 2014, I decided to join the ICS major hearing about the mobile game called 'The Flappy Bird'. Developing mobile game sounded very interesting, and this made me to register for ICS111, which is the introduction to programming. However, as the time passed by and I started learning more about programming, my interest turned towards web development and web design. I found it very enjoyable looking at websites that are well designed and easy to read, and I wanted to make those websites myself. 

Taking multiple ICS courses, I figured that I would suit for front-end development than back-end development, knowing that it does not interest me to work with things I can not visually see the result of. Web development/design is perfect for this reason because I can actually see the results to my self and change how it looks until I am satisfied.

I have always wanted to learn how to build a website. I am currently in the process of learning Javascript, and I hope to learn the programming skills and gain detailed knowledge about web development in the future.
