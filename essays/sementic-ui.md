## What is a framework?

Let's say you are building a website. You have a choice of writing hundred lines of code, or write one-fourth of the code (or even lesser) that works exactly the same. What would you choose?
As a programmer, you always want to write simple but legible code. If this is the case, framework is the answer. Framework is a wrapper that repackages a function or a set of functions which helps increase efficiency of programming. It is an abstraction of functionality that can be reused.
With framework, you are now free from writing the same boring code blocks over and over again!

## Web frameworks - good and bad?

Web framework has many advantages. One of the best benefits is increase of efficiency. Pre-built functions make development to be much easier and faster, and less stressful. Most frameworks are free of cost, which means anybody can create a well-made website. Even if you are new to web development, it is still possible to create a well-made website with just a little bit of research thanks to the documentations that comes with most of the frameworks. However, knowing how to use a framework does not necessarily mean you know the language. Also, Programmers will often face the limitation using a framework, since they have their own set of rules that can not be modified. For this reason, it is very important to find a right framework that suits you best if you decide to use one.

## Framework? I love it! ---

My personal experience with [Sementic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) has been going great so far. I did not know creating website could be this simple and enjoyable until I was introduced to Sementic UI. I have replicated various local websites such as [Island Snow](http://islandsnow.com/), [Bar35](http://www.bar35hawaii.com/), [Hawaiian Brian's](http://hawaiianbrians.com/) and [Murphy's](http://murphyshawaii.com/), and it could not have been any easier.
I am very excited to learn more about web development in the future, and I would definitely recommend using frameworks to anybody that does not know about it.
