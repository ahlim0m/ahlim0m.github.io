## Configuration Management ?

“Configuration management” is a central software engineering skill. It allows programmers to keep track of the changes made to the source codes and the environment, thus making it possible to work with multiple others. Without a proper configuration management, building large and complex software system would be extremely difficult and nearly impossible, because being unable to keep track of other people's work and changes will result in mixed up codes.

## Git --- Github

Git is a version control system used for tracking changes to files, that makes it possible for multiple people to coordinate and work together without stepping on each other's toes.
