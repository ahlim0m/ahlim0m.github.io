## Configuration Management ?

“Configuration management” is a central software engineering skill that allows programmers to keep track of the changes made to the source codes and the environment, thus making it possible to work with multiple others. Without a proper configuration management, building large and complex software system would be extremely difficult and nearly impossible, because being unable to keep track of other people's work and changes will result in mixed up codes.

## Git -- Version Control System

[Git](www.git-scm.com/) is the most commonly used [version control system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) around the world. Git provides multiple useful features such as committing new changes, branching, merging and comparing past versions. Being able to track changes makes it possible for multiple people to coordinate and work together without stepping on each other's toes. Without a version control system, you will need to notify all members of the team about the changes made every single time, which is very cumbersome and inconvenient.

## Github is better?

[Github](www.github.com) is a web-based version control repository. Github is based upon Git, with extra features added.
What makes Github strong is that it provides personal space for the users. Files uploaded in repositories can be shared with selected people, to the public, or just to oneself, allowing multiple people to work together, get resources, and learn. Github could be a perfect portfolio for programmers, since it is the most commonly used website to reference to your past projects and show your abilities.

I personally think Git made it possible for Github to be the top cloud-based software hosting platform. Github is a hosting service platform, that allows people to work with Git in a more effective and simple way. Without Git, I would say Github would lose more than half of its power. None the less, Git can still function well without Github, but not the other way around.
