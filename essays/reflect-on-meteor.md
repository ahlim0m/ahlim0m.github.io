## Meteor appears like a meteor

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) came to me like a meteor. It was new, mysterious, and powerful.
Before being introduced to Meteor, I had a very limited knowledge on full-stack development.
When I say limited knowledge, I mean almost close to nothing. For instance, I knew full-stack
development has something to do with both front-end back-end. And yes, that was all I knew about it.
It turns out full-stack development is an essential component of developing professional and advanced
websites which not only deals with nicely designed user interface, but also with databases to
perform more complex actions. Even with the learning curves, meteor is a perfect full-stack development
platform to create websites.

## Facing the learning curves
Meteor is not easy. At least for myself, it took quite a while to figure out what each files are used for,
how routing works, and learn the importance of the import statements. It required a lot of going back and forth between files and codes, but it was definitely doable. To fully understand the relations and different use of each directories and files, I will need to do a lot more learning, and maybe a little bit of banging my head against a wall.

## Meteor does it for me dear
Despite the learning curves and headaches Meteor has given, it also took away a lot of weight on my shoulders. If I were to do a full-stack, fully functional web development without the help of a framework like Meteor, I can not even imagine how much work I would have to go through to do everything on their own and put them all together. With Meteor, or other web framework, developer can now only worry about code and nothing else.

## Don't Worry, Everything is Cool
I honestly think everything about Meteor is cool. Building a fully functional web app was something I have
always wanted to learn and do, but I just could not figure out where to start from. Building a web app with
meteor using everything we have learned so far such as javascript and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) has definitely gave me an idea and taught me the concept of web development.
Meteors' auto-refresh feature was one of the convenient features I really liked, for which I could just
code, go back to the page and see the changes made right away. All I can say about Meteor and people who are about to learn Meteor is not to worry, because everything is cool.
